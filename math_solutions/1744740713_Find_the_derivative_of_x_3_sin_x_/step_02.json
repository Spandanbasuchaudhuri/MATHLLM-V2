The power rule states that if we have a function f(x) = x^n, then its derivative is given by: f'(x) = nx^(n-1) In this case, n = 3, so: u'(x) = 3x^(3-1) = 3x^2 For the second factor, we'll use the chain rule for differentiation. The chain rule states that if we have a function f(x) = g(h(x)), then its derivative is given by: f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \\ h'(x) In this case, let's define g(t) = sin(t), and let h(x) = x. Then: v'(x) = g'(h(x)) \\ h'(x) = cos(x) \\ 1 (since h'(x) = 1)",
